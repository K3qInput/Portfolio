The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
[line 100](#L100) shows the error message indicating that the deploy did not succeed because the deploy directory 'dist/public' does not exist.

**Solution:**
The issue is that the specified deployment directory 'dist/public' doesn't exist in the build process. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the correct build output directory is configured. Since the build script is `node build-static.js`, you should verify that this script is correctly generating the static files into the 'dist/public' directory. If the files are generated elsewhere, you will need to update the `publish` directory in the configuration to reflect the correct build output location. Make sure that the static files are being generated in the expected directory before deploying.

If you need to change the directory structure or adjust the build configuration, make the necessary changes in the build script or deployment configuration to ensure the static files are correctly placed in the specified directory before deployment.
